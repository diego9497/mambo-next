    "historyDescription": [
      "At the beginning of the 20th century the first examples of modern painting are seen in Colombia, the artists sought new forms of painting and sculpture, appropriating the heritage of Dadaism and Cubism to detach themselves from the aesthetics of the beautiful.",
      "Colombia was also the scene of the global debate between capitalism vs. communism and the impulse to transform its context led artists to question established morality and propose works of art with transgressive political content.",
      "The desire to unlinkColombian art history of the European tradition, motivated the artists of the “Bachué” group to investigate symbols and images of local indigenous and peasant expressions. ",
      "01 From the 50s influenced by political events such as El Bogotazo, the artists assumed strong political positions, expressed in the confrontation between those who defended socialist realism and the defense of",
      "an own identity, against those who supported abstract expressionism. This contrast between abstraction and figurative art was decisive for the artists of the sixties and the origin of contemporary art. (Jaramillo, 2012. p. 129 - p. 206) "
