    "historyDescription": "In 1953, General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla mounted a military coup, establishing a dictatorship that restricted the rights and freedoms of the citizens of Colombia. Nevertheless, during this period important steps were taken in the modernisation of the country. One of these was a decree leading to the creation of the Museum of Modern Art, signed in 1955 by a group comprising intellectuals, artists and government ministers. \n\n The Museum existed for several years without a permanent site. During this time, it occupied various venues, including the National University and the District Planetarium. The critic and administrator Marta Traba was a driving force behind opening the Museum to the public from 1962, until 1967, when she was expelled from the country for her objection to military intervention at the National University, where the Museum was then based. Gloria Zea took over as director when the Museum left the university campus, managing various sites until the acquisition in 1974, of the plot on which the present building now stands. Construction began in 1979 and was completed in 1985 (Zea, 1994, pp.50-78).n\n Today, MAMBO is situated in the centre of the city, neighbouring both the Parque Bicentenario and the Parque de la Independencia and within easy walking distance of the District Planetarium. It is housed in a building designed by Colombian architect Rogelio Salmona, based on the principles of abstract art, and modern architecture in Bogotá (Moreno y Medina,1994, pp.88-92).n\n MAMBO has worked for 57 years in the research, preservation and promotion of modern and contemporary art. The artist Claudia Hakim took over as director in 2016, heading a new team with aims to work with the general public on a variety of projects involving curatorship, museography, and education. ",

    "historyDescription": "Modern Art was a process during which painters, sculptors and writers sought out novel forms of representation. The modern period in art is usually described as occurring between 1850 – 1970. The industrial revolutions of nineteenth century Europe and the violent upheavals inspired by the 1789 Revolution in France, all contributed to the modern movement. Artists rebelled against academic art with its Renaissance preoccupations; religion, Greek mythology, and the traditional genres of portrait and still life, preferring to explore individual interests and problems in their work (Gallerix, 2009).\n\n In the 1830s the invention of photography caused a break with the tradition of figurative representation and led artists to create work according to a personal aesthetic. The work of the European vanguards exemplifies formal and conceptual explorations made by artists of this period as they experimented with new subjects, materials, techniques and processes, pushing the boundaries of what was understood as “art”.

    "historyDescription": "In Colombia, the first examples of modernist painting start to appear during the early years of the twentieth century. Artists taking on the legacy of Dadaism and cubism searched for new forms in painting and sculpture as an escape from the traditional aesthetic of beauty.\n\n Colombia was also a scenario for the global debate between capitalism and communism, and the drive for change led artists to question established moral principles in politically transgressive artworks. A desire to uncouple Colombian art history from the European tradition, inspired the “Bachué” group of artists to explore the imagery and symbols of local indigenous and rural communities.\n\n From the 1950s onwards, influenced by political events such as El Bogotazo, artists adopted a firm political stance, clearly seen in the confrontation between the defenders of socialist realism and the maintenance of a separate identity, and the supporters of abstract expressionism.

    "history": "What is Conceptual Art?",
    "historyDescription": "Conceptual Art (also known as Conceptualism), has its beginnings during the 1960s and consists in recognising art not only for its aesthetic qualities, but also for its intellectual significance. Conceptual art does not use one medium in particular, as it does not rely on form, but on content and the ability to communicate an idea. For this reason, it may take different forms: installation, photography, readymade, performance, graphic work or video art.\n\n Conceptual artists are interested in context. They take a theme and confer new meanings on objects, images and concepts through their work. With Land Art for example, an interest in space has led artists to alter the landscape and make use of available materials. Minimalism, on the other hand, makes no attempt to represent an outside reality, “what you see is what you see” (Tate, s. f.). \n\n During the 1960s and 1970s great social changes were brought about through activism on the part of various movements: Feminist, LGBT, and antiracist movements, protests against the Vietnam War and the May 1968 demonstrations in Paris.\n Conceptual art often pinpoints and denounces social, political, religious or ecological problems, with frequent use of irony and satire. It also questions the significance of art itself, asserting that what is “art” is subjectively determined by the artist themselves, while the spectator completes the work with their own interpretation (EcuRed, 2019).

This period of restricted freedoms began with the 1953 Military Coup of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and lasted for 16 years. Conceptual art in Colombia evolved out of reaction to despotism prevalent in political and artistic institutions, under which artists, like Feliza Bursztyn, were persecuted and forced to leave the country.\n\n Conceptual artists in Colombia experimented with new media and formats, combining artistic disciplines such as the readymade, photography, and installation, among others. Artistic collectives, such as El Sindicato were formed, which challenged individualism and put forward new ideas about society in their manifestos (Barrios, 1999). Means of reproduction such as photocopy and screen-printing helped democratise art and move it away from official spheres. The Salón Nacional de Artistas sparked debates and controversy revealing artists’ desire to break away from this institution. The Salón did not recognise conceptual art until 1978, when it awarded first prize to “A-la-cena con Zapatos” (Dinner with Shoes) by El Sindicato. (Herrera, 2011)",

A controversial and transgressive artist, she defied artistic convention in her sculptural work, using materials such as scrap iron, aluminium waste and engine parts. She also made use of sound and movement. Her series of bed-sculptures draped with shiny material appear to contain bodies in movement during the sexual act. With this, Feliza sought to stage a private and intimate moment and bring it out into the public space. She creates an atmosphere of eroticism and enfolds the spectator in an experience both moving and sensual"

Contemporary artists take art practice to its limits and seek to generate critical reflection in the observer through their enquiries. Artists embrace other fields of knowledge in a transdisciplinary manner.\n\n Globalisation and internet access permit expansion of new technologies, the screen affording the public a new and greater proximity to the image (Ampudia, 2016). The incursion of technology and new media brings diverse possibilities for the relationship between artworks, artist and public, frequently resulting in offerings that are in interactive and relational, such as the happening and the performance. In contemporary art, the spectator is often required to step up and participate in the work, giving them the opportunity to immerse themselves in multi-sensory environments (Pazos, 2018). ",

    "historyDescription": "From the 1950s onwards, Colombia underwent significant social change marked by rapid urban growth due to internal displacement and modernisation. New ways of representing the urban landscape were a recurrent theme for artists such as Fernell Franco, Carlos Caicedo and Dora Franco, who used photography in an artistic manner, connecting with other areas of visual production such as design, publicity, popular graphics, and the media.\n\n Struggles for rights and gender equality drove the creation of works centred around the body, homoerotism and sexuality, with art becoming a space for free expression. María Evelia Marmolejo, Luis Caballero and Karen Lamassonne all created work based around their gender identity, combining techniques such as drawing, video and performance. Social and political tensions during the 60s and 70s prompted art that dared call into question national, religious and cultural symbols; as reflected in the work of Antonio Caro and Bernardo Salcedo (Jaramillo, Suarez and Wills, 2018).\n\n The Bogotá Museum of Modern Art (MAMBO) joined with the Modern Art Museums of Medellín, Cali y Barranquilla in highlighting artists of different regions. Two decisive events for contemporary art in Colombia took place at the MAMBO: the exhibition Espacios Ambientales (Environmental Spaces), which brought the installation to Colombia; and the Salones Atenas, which reinforced the country’s burgeoning contemporary art movement (Jaramillo, 2012).",
